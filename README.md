# About
This program simply generates a html page to be used as a home page in a browser.

The need for this program arose for me after my browser randomly lost all my bookmarks. Using a generated html page lifts the need to store bookmarks in the browser itself. This also solves an issue in situation where you use multiple browsers, now, by setting this one file as home page, every browser gets the same bookmarks. The program also installs a javascript together with the home page which enables hotkeys to work, allowing much quicker access to pages for keyboard driven browsing.

# Start
The program is currently unfinished.
